My name is Connor Escajeda and I am currently a junior studying computer science at Hendrix College! I also am a team captain of our track team and my main event is the 400m. During the school year I spend most of my time either doing homework or am practicing. In the little bit of spare time I do find during the years I spend working on small side projects or spend time with my friends. In the breaks, I try to commit to larger scale solo projects such as this website to add to my portfolio and because I just enjoy getting to make fun programs! In the summer, for fun I spend a lot of time at Beaver Lake with my family surfing on our boat! I hope you enjoy the website :)
