This setup experience was a somewhat tedious and annoying process because of all the random errors I would get while trying to do things in the command prompt. Thankfully with the help of ol' reliable, Google, I was able to fix all the errors I was having an get Jekyll up and running. Almost all aspects of this were new to me, I wasn't unfamiliar with a command prompt I have done quite a few things with that throughout my life but installing ruby and setting up the Jekyll server were definitely new things for me. I really didn't struggle with getting anything set up, I only had one real issue and it was with something not getting installed but that just took a quick search to figure out what was going wrong and what to do to fix it. I think so far everything is making sense but I do know I will have to do some research into the layouts and page stuff for the upcoming lab. I am excited to see what I am able to do with this website and the cool things I might be able to do with it!
