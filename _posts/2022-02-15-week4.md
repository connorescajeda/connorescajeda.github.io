Over this last week I have had two projects to work on, the GIS portfolio and Solar eclipse websites. For the GIS portfolio the main things I have been working through is adding small things here and there to make it look pretty and fit what Dr. Hill had been originally working on. Along with that I have been working on Siteleaf to see if it will be a possible way for people with less technical skills to use a jekyll blog but still have a lot of the same utilities. It is seeming to be that Siteleaf actually offers a lot of potential in this area and am really excited to see where the rest of this project goes. Now for the solar eclipse website, I haven't gotten too deep into doing anything on it yet other than recreating it within a minima jekyll blog and getting it close to what it was from the original project having. Over the next week the plan is to recreate the solar eclipse website in a new theme and see where that goes.
