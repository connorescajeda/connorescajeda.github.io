title: Calculus II Course Description
---
This course continues the study of calculus begun in MATH 130. Primary goals of the course are solving initial value problems, learning standard techniques of integration (integration by parts, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions), becoming familiar with Taylor polynomial approximations and Taylor series expansions of standard functions, and employing these ideas in real-world applications. Numerical, geometric, and analytic approaches to the fundamental ideas of calculus are emphasized throughout the course. Graphing calculators and mathematics software are fundamental tools. Prerequisite: MATH 130 or advanced placement
