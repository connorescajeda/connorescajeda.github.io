This hasn't been the most eventful week for me in terms of items completed. After last Wednesday the plan for me as to implement a specialties page on the website but I ran into issues there and passed that off to Dr. Goadrich and instead worked on displaying specialities on the details page and that ended up being a quick fix to implement. Then I looked a little bit into AWS vs Azure Blob Storage so that we can store pictures and we have decide to go the route of AWS. My next step is going to be ensuring that we can use those pictures on the arboreteum app and that it works correctly. I will also be trying to use a stock tree image to fix broken tree images. It seems that we are coming to a close on the arboreteum and I believe I will be taking a look at the assessment website after this which is exciting!
