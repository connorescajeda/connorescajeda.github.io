So for this week some of my plans took an unexpected turn. Jonathon ended up using a new theme for the Solar Eclipse website and I decided to stick with him and use that one as well but ran into a lot of issues with getting it to work correctly on my machine and for the life of me could not figure out the problem. I spent quite a bit of time trying to get this to work because I had wanted to make a lot of progress on it but really I ended up just wasting 2-3 hours not understanding why it wasn't working. On the brightside, before running into this issue I spent a lot of time polishing the GIS website and I am really pleased with how it looks. I will just need to see what Dr. Goadrich thinks of the post system and what changes we could make to allow for it to be user-friendly but also allow for really nice looking posts.
