This week has been really productive! It started off a bit slow because of being unable to make it to last weeks meeting but I talked to Jonathon to get caught up on what we needed to do. Ian, Jonathon and I then planned to meet over the weekend to create the simplified tree we presented on Monday. To prepare for this I spent my time looking through the complicated tree we had and continuing to gain a better understanding of the flow that is already in place for the game. On Sunday, we all met together and had a really productive session creating the tree and we were even able to brainstorm some good ideas that are we starting to implement such as the classroom scene that I am working on. On Monday, we solidifed what things we needed to get done this week before we demo for career services. My job is to create a new classroom scene for the game which is currently a work in progress. I have finished most of it out but I need to do a few more lines of script. Then I will be going through and creating a text list of the choices you create so at the end of the game you can see the path you took and what the benefits and downsides of that were. We will eventually try to make this a visual tree but we don't have the time for that this week. Overall, today I am going to be finishing out the classroom scene and hope to start work on the text tree soon!
