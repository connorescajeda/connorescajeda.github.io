My apoligies for the lack of updates over the week, it seemed to keep slipping my head. Over the last month, all of my coding work has gone towards the Lake Nixon app which has has some vast improvements. We have rehauled the backend and made numerous changes to the features. We have a much better schedule creation tools that allow you to see what groups have already been selected for things, how many people are in certain events and other things like that. We also have filtering for specific things on the master calender to help make it a more viewable. I also met with Mike during this time to demo the app and he loved it! He had no complaints and is just generally super excited to see where it goes. Overall, I have really enjoyed my time working on this app and I am exicted to keep working on it up until I graduate!
