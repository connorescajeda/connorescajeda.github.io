title: Sci Comp Course Description
---
Students visualize scientific data from a wide variety of sources, perform data analysis and dimensionality reduction using clustering techniques, understand system dynamics through differential equation approximation and agent-based modeling, construct probabilistic Monte-Carlo simulation models, and optimize continuous and discrete problems with local search techniques. Topics may include Markov models, bioinformatics, and signal processing. Each assignment requires writing a clear and coherent data analysis report that properly characterizes legitimate conclusions to be drawn from the data. Prerequisite: MATH 130 and CSCI 150
