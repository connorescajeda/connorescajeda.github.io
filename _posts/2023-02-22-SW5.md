This was a big week of progress in terms of the Hendrix Today app. I was able to successfully have events work with the calendar which nows mean the pipeline of them uploading to Excel, Excel uploading to Firebase and then Firebase correctly uploading to the calendar is a successful prototype! This can obviously be refined to so many more levels but it at working enough point that we are exicted to show the Communications people about it tomorrow. Once we have met with them we will be able to figure out what our next steps are and go from there and I am excited to see what happens.
