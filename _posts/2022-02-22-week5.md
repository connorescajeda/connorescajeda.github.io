For this week most of my time was consumed by the Solar Eclipse website and changing the theme. I had a lot of struggles that I had to go through before I started making real progress because I was misunderstanding how to use the jekyll themes but I know how that all works now. I recreated all of the solar eclipse website into this new theme and have pushed it a bit further than what it used to have but now I need to finish filling out all of the tabs on the navbar with some google forms and then work on some of the css of it and it should be all ready to go! I also finished my Arkansas asset builders training. Over the next week, I am planning on finishing the solar eclipse website and ironing out the rest of the GIS website and reaching out to both of the respective professors about them.
