This week has been a week of putting together a lot of final things to prepare for a final push to send the game out! I have mostly been tasked with cleaning up some scenes and then adding a lot of the map scenes that havent been finished yet. My current goal is the finish up all of the scene I am tasked with by tomorrow so that way I can put my full efforts into hardcore testing to make sure the game is ready to go. I am ready to make this final push and hopefully get a chance to try and do something else but I also wouldn't mind getting to do some understanding of the data we pull in about the CC game after we add the google analytics into the game.
