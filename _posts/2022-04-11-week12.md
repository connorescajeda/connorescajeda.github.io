So following the demo of the arboretum website last week, we went back to the drawing board on what we should do with it. The vertical format just was not quite looking how we wanted it to so we decided on breaking into three rows and doing things within columns inside those three rows. It took me awhile to get this down but after getting it working it was so much nicer than the original way we had designed. Of course there are still some bugs that I need to get worked out with the map when I shrink it but I have a solid demo to show for the meeting.

In other regards, for next year with Disco Tray I am looking forward to hopefully getting to dabble in some new things but also stick with what I know. I have gotten a lot of work in the website area now and I feel that I can do some really cool things with that and want to see what I am able to do there!
