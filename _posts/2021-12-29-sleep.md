title: Sleep and Dreaming Course Description
---
This course covers basic psychological principles by applying them to the study of sleep and dreaming. Students will combine hands-on experiences (e.g., keeping a wake-sleep diary, observing a night in a sleep lab) with theoretical readings and discussion on topics such as, what is sleep, measurement of sleep, circadian rhythms, sleep hygiene, sleep disorders, sleep deprivation, and dream theories.
