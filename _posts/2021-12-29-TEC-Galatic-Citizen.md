title: The Galactic Citizen Course Description
---
We will use science fiction novels, short stories, and television episodes to explore issues affecting humanityâ€”and even what it means to be human. How does the advancement of technology affect who we are? How can we determine what is and is not plausible scientific advancement? How does a writer whose characters are pointy-eared aliens use space battles and lasers to tell a story about racism? What literary and cinematographic techniques do authors use to write Sci-fi? The course will combine the scientific and literary analysis for students to critically think about and engage with issues in the modern world.
