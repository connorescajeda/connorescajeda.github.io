## Week 1
My first week of Disco Tray Studios is most likely going to be the least busy one I have for the rest of my time. I spent my time getting myself added onto the Jekyll website, where I added my picture and a short little bio as well as moved the former student working here to the alumni section. The rest of my time was spent playing and takings notes on the games on Itch.io so that I could give advice from a new eye about things that could be changed to make the game better or more UI friendly.

## Week 2
In the second week I started to begin taking on more tasks and finding my role with the team. I am going to be taking a lot of the Database projects from the class I was in last semester Databases and Web Systems. I am going to be helping refine these projects into more presentable websites for whichever clients want us to keep working on their website. I spent this week mostly getting familiar with one of the first projects I will look at which is the Arkansas Asset Builders website. I made a few small visual changes but didn't do much more because we haven't received a lot of information on what to do with it yet. The other project that took my time was working on the ill-fated lab 9 from the Databases class and seeing if the changes from IT now allow it to work. It does seem that it does actually work now! Which is awesome news but I will have to go through this next week and finish up the last couple of parts of the lab to confirm a few things for Dr. Goadrich but hopefully I will be writing about this next week with awesome news!
