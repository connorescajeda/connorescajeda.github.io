It feels nice to be able to post one of these again and hopefully this semester I will be better about it. I am excited to get back in to the swing of things with Disco Tray! So far I haven't had too muych to but I have done some of the finishing touches on the GIS website and launched it and am working on a guide to give to Dr. Hill. I am also excited to pick up some work on Career Competencies with Ian and Jonathon. I think that will be a lot of fun and I am excited to be able to start off with some group work. I don't think there is much else to say except that I am excited to get this rolling and ready to see where we go!
