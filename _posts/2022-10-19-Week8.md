I haven't been able to do a whole lot since last Wednesday because of Fall Break and then having to attend a wedding on Monday but I have made some progress. I have pretty much finished the web demo and now am looking to find out what to do next in our meeting. My first thought of something to try is to create a simple mobile app that can have a DB in the backend and then create a web app that can interact with the same backend as an admin. This is because this is what we will be next semester so I think if I can have this figured out before then we can be in a really good position to work on the mobile apps.
