So it has been nice not having to stress over the CC game and its been nice to work on something new. I haven't had the most time to get stuff done but I am currently doing lots of troubleshooting with getting a firebase backend to work on it. I haven't spent a ton of time working on it but so far I'm having trouble with when I push to github, the database isn't building so that is going to be what I spend my next week trying to figure out. I'm really excited to try and get this working because it is going to be really nice for my mobile development project and I think it could actually really help my website for personal use.
