Yay!! Finally some good news on this week. I have fully completed the Admin specialities checkboxes!!! They are nicely formatted and they correctly add and remove specilaties and save them into the DB. I have also tested this by adding and confirming on the map that it works correctly! This was a bit of struggle because it had been almost a year since I had touched the DB side of Razor Pages and had to relearn a lot of it and work through a DB I had never touched. However, I did manage to get it all figured out and I am happy super to say that I am all done with it and am ready to move onto other things in the arboretum and the tasks should be much faster now that I am more accustomed to the code base!
