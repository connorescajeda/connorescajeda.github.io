Last Wednesday I started back up on the arboretum project. I first had to set the repo back up and work through some issues with .Net compatabilties problems but I solved those and began making sure I could connect
to the remote DB. I was able to get an account created and succesfully login on my local client which indicated that I had gotten all of the code in the right spots to do this. From here, I have started working on 
creating a way within in a tree page to toggle on/off for all of the different specialties of each tree. So far this is giving me some trouble because it appears that specialties lie in a weird spot and not within the tree table. I may be 
understanding this wrong but so far in my expierence I can't just include the specialties in the tree. I'm currently in the process of adapting the way that we display specialties on the map into a way that I get access to the specialities and use 
them for my purpose of the on/off toggle. My goal by Monday is to hopefully have gotten this working and have rough demo of the toggling system.
