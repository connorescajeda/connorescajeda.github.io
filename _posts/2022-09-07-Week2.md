This week was exciting! I am happy to be able to say that I have met with Dr. Hill and officially handed of the GIS website fully. You can visit it here [GIS Website](http://mapping21centuryhdx.siteleaf.net/). Dr. Hill really liked it and is exicted for what he will be able to do with it. I have told him that any questions he may have that he can contact me and I will stay in touch and help with whatever he needs. At some point, when we figure out how to connect sites to hendrix.edu, he would want to connect the site there. Other than this I have been working on getting up to speed on the career competencies game. I have enjoyed my time with it thus far and it has been interesting to see all the work those two have done on it. I will be sharing some things I have found while and some possible recommendations with Ian and Jonathon whenever I get the chance to.
