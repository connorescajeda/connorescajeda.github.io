title: Algorithms Course Description
---
Introduction to algorithm design strategies that build upon data structures and programming techniques introduced in earlier courses. Strategies discussed include brute-force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, problem reduction, and greedy algorithms. Topics covered include graph traversal and shortest paths, string matching, searching, sorting, and advanced data structures such as balanced search trees, heaps, hash tables, state machines, and union-find structures. The course includes an introduction to complexity theory and the complexity classes P and NP. Prerequisites: CSCI 151 and MATH 240
