I have a mostly complete form of the single page arboretum finished up with some small formatting things needing to be cleaned up and plan to be demoing that tomorrow. I am really happy with the progress that I have been able to make and love seeing the growth I have made in being able to work within the razor page environment and how my knowledge of html and css has grown. For the next week, I will see how the demo goes and make changes according to that.
