This week has been a tough week for me. I have been pretty stuck with getting the group names to show up on events on the calender but I think I am getting there and I have also been adding and looking other issues. That is really all I have been up to in terms of the Lake Nixon app. I also have been super busy with end of the year class things and its put a big hamper on my productivity. With that being said I think moving forward my goal for the next week and a half is just try to finish out and document as much stuff as possible about the app so that moving forward it can be finished up and eventually given to Mike. There is just too many small pieces and little things that would have to completed in the next week that I can't do alone to get this app to a place of what I could be happy calling it finished. All in all, I am super happy with where it is and hope to get it to a good spot before I move on.
