I've had a lot of issues over the past week with understanding the DB and how exactly it is working. I've spent most of my time just banging my head against the wall trying to understand what is happening but I have made some progress. The biggest thing I have done is figure out how exactly printing is working on Visual Studio and with that I have been able to confirm that my SQL join is working as intended which is going to allow me to move forward with creating the checkboxes and is going to help me go much further with being able to understand how the DB is setup and what I can do with it. Through the next work the work is going to be creating the checkboxes and having them change things within the DB.
