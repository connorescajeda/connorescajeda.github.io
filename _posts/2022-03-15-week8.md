This week was another tough week in terms of the amount of time I actually got to work on things but I did manage to crack the case of how to use jekyll front matter along with siteleaf. I learned a lot about how to do that and have pretty much wrapped up the GIS website and now all I need to do is meet with Dr. Hill and see what he thinks and then make any changes that he requests. I also took some time to dive into the Arboretum project and get more familiar with it and I am excited to take the chance to work on something different! I am however sad to not be getting to do as much work on the GIS project because I do think I enjoyed Jekyll more than razor pages but nonetheless all experience is good experience.
