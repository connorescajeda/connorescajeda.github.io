My work during this week consisted of finishing up lab 9 once and for all and confirming to Dr. Goadrich that you can successfully do every part of it over Hendrix Wifi. The other project that took up most of my time over the week was turning my personal project from Databases and Web Systems, the GIS portfolio, into a jekyll blog. This didn't take too much time overall because I had become fairly familiar with jekyll over winter break while making my own blog. It was really nice to create the website in this format because it offered so many things that we were having to try and implement ourselves for the database project. I am going to be really excited to finish this up and give Dr. Hill what he hopefully was wanting to get.
