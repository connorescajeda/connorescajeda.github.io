This week I mainly focused on finishing out my classroom scene which is exactly what I did! I am really happy with how it looks and what I was able to get done. I didn't have much time to do anything else other than that Jonathon, Ian and I all discussed future plans and organized our github issues on the repo. I think going into the next week I am going to put the finishing touches on my scene and make sure all of the numerical values for competenices are added and working. Overall, I feel like the game is coming together well but the main struggle is just pushing through and making scenes because it hasn't really been something I am enjoying
