We switched gears this week so that we could try to put some attention onto the Lake Nixon App. Before I talk too much about that though, we met with the Hendrix Today people last Thursday and that went really well! They really liked how the app was starting to look and were super pleased with the functionality of it. With their help we have the things we would like to get into place before we would start a small trial run of Hendrix Today app on campus! Now shifting back to Lake Nixon, the biggest thing I have accomplished with this week is that I have gotten the schedulur to look at all of the groups that are already in events at a certain time and not include them in the selection menu when adding them to an event. This meaning that when Mike is picking events for the 9:30 time slot, none of the teams already in an event at 9:30 will be shown when making selections. This will be a super helpful feature for Mike and is going to help cut down on scheduling time by A LOT.
