It has been quite nice being able to get back into working on things! I had an awesome spring break just getting to relax and not worry too much about anything, it was very much needed. I however have now been brought back into the world of reality and have been working on the arboretum website. I first started by creating a button that randomly selects a tree and lets us see it so that the map is able to easily be populated. Then I began work on turning the website into being only one page which required a lot of dissecting the old but after a while I began to get an understanding of it. After a few hours I was able to get together a pretty rudimentary showing of a single page website where the tree information is shown on the main page and I will demoing that in the meeting tomorrow and then working on it some more so that it looks much more clean and respectable.
