This week was a busy one, we had to pull together all of the finishing touches on the CC game. For me that meant cleaning up some of the map scenes and adding all of the Welcome Center and some Mills map scenes. After that, I went through and added a bunch of character expressions which ended taking a while but it helped add a lot of realism to the game which was really nice. Then on Monday, we did just a few more small changes and rolled out the game which is super exciting! I enjoyed the time I spent getting to work on this game but I definitely think I want to stay away from having to make dialogue for games and want to go back to working on things I am more familiar with.
