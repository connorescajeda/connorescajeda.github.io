This hasn't been my best week of progress due to being really busy with classes but when I have had time I have spent most of it just chugging away on the Lake Nixon app. I haven't made any substantial changes, I have mostly just been looking at how to best go about making the scheduling process smoother and how to clean up the code. This is because it is kind of a mess in the code and I want to make it more understandable so other people can figure out what is going on. I am exicted to get one more week of progress going and get a chance to show what we've done on this to Mike!
