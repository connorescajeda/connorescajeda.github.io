This week has been hard for me to get nearly as much as I wanted done due to some other circumstances. During our meeting I did solve my issues with the solar eclipse website and it was coming from not having it within a /blog folder. From the meeting, Dr. Goadrich recommened trying to change some of the defauly front matter to have some of the aspects of what makes a pretty post so that it can be more user friendly and allow the use of siteleaf. I have managed to succeed in this and have gained a lot more understanding of how to use front matter through siteleaf and I think that I could manage to do a lot more cools things with this given the time. I am going to try and do some more work on the solar eclipse website tonight and tomorrow but I am not sure if it will be completely finished.
