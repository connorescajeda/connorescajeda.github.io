## IT Intern with PNC Bank
I had this job from May 2021 - August 2021 and worked 40 hours a week within a professional programming team working within an AGILE development cycle on a program called "Enterprise!". Enterprise! is an advanced, integrated platform that streamlines loan servicing, asset management, loan accounting & investor reporting. I was a part of a team that was under the umbrella of client priorities where we would meet with clients and get their feedback on new features they wanted added to the software and any issues they may have encountered. We would then develop stories and assign work accordingly and then get as much done over a 2 week period before coming back together to assess. During this experience I was worked through Azure DevOps using mostly C#, VB, SQL, as well as JavaScript. I also was able to work with a large group of programmers during this internship where I was able to learn a lot of things from people who had been in the industry for 15-30 years.

## Teaching Assistant for Computer Science at Hendrix College
I held this position from January 2021 - May 2021 and worked around 10 hours a week helping students within lab and outside of class on problems they may encounter. During lab I worked with the professor to help students understand the material and to successfully create the finished product for the specific lab. In my tutor hours, I would help students learn how to debug their code and explain core concepts of computer sciences so they can learn to think like a programmer so they are better able to approach future problems.
